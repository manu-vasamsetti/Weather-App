## API Integration

### OpenWeatherMap API
The application uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data. You need to replace the `API_KEY` in `script.js` with your own API key from OpenWeatherMap.

1. Sign up on [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) to get your API key.
2. Replace the `API_KEY` value in `script.js` with your API key.
    ```javascript
    const API_KEY = "your_api_key_here";
    ```

## Usage

### Enter a City Name
1. Enter the name of the city in the input field.
2. Click the "Search" button or press "Enter".
3. The current weather and 5-day forecast will be displayed.

### Use Current Location
1. Click the "Current Location" button.
2. Allow the browser to access your location.
3. The current weather and 5-day forecast for your location will be displayed.

## Code Explanation

### HTML
- `index.html` contains the structure of the web application including input fields, buttons, and containers for displaying weather data.

### CSS
- `style.css` contains the styling for the application, making it visually appealing and responsive.

### JavaScript
- `script.js` contains the logic for fetching weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and updating the DOM to display the data.

### Key Functions in `script.js`
- `createWeatherCard(cityName, weatherItem, index)`: Creates the HTML for the weather cards.
- `getWeatherDetails(cityName, latitude, longitude)`: Fetches weather details using the coordinates.
- `getCityCoordinates()`: Fetches the coordinates of the entered city name.
- `getUserCoordinates()`: Fetches the coordinates using the user's current location.
